# PixelAlchemy: Image-to-Image Translation

## Overview

PixelAlchemy is a fascinating project that harnesses the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to perform enchanting transformations on images. This magical endeavor specifically focuses on translating satellite images into maps and infusing life into black-and-white photos by transforming them into vibrant color images.
